-- | The meaning of expressions is defined by how they can be reduced.

-- which describes how 'Drop' scope delimiters propogate through expressions.
--
-- This function takes an expression and either reduces it,

-- (from within the context of the logical system, i.e. without regard to representation).

-- TODO: Scope conversion isn't a real conversion relationship!

-- That doesn't break the code, but I don't want to misrepresent it.
-- 'scopeExpand' is only the *left* inverse of 'scopeReduce',
-- not the inverse overall.
--
-- Alternatively, 'scopeExpand' could be defined on expressions with no sub-expressions.
-- That would make sense, but then 'scopeReduce' would also have to be defined like that,
-- which would make every reduction valid as well, meaning we can't use it in the same way
-- we use the other reduction, because it always succeeds, and thus every expression
-- could be considered reducible.
--
-- Perhaps delimiting scope should be external to the notion of an expression,
-- like how Thyer represented it in the "Lazy Specialization" paper
-- (http://thyer.name/phd-thesis/thesis-thyer.pdf).
--
-- In addition, it really doesn't fit in with the current scheme of reductions.
-- It doesn't apply to any particular constructor/eliminator relationship,
-- instead being this bizarre syntactical fragment instead of a real expression.
-- After all, I could have also chosen to represent the calculus
-- so that variables are parameterized by `Fin n` instead of being wrapped in stacks of 'Drop'.
--
-- I think this problem will work itself out as I work further on evaluation strategies
-- and alternative representations, but for now, it'll do.
-- | Scope-conversion describes how 'Drop'-delimited scopes propgate through expressions.
